The Weathercast application notifies the user about
the weather conditions like min-max temperature, humidity, windspeed, AQI (Air Quality Index), UVI
(Ultraviolet Index) of any particular location around the globe. This application has been developed using
android studio and the soft wares used are XML (for front-end programming), JAVA (for back-end
programming). The app focuses on forecasting weather conditions using historical data. This is done by
extracting information from OpenWeathermap API. The app has a salient feature of comparing the weather
conditions of two locations making the app more user-friendly. The app also updates the user about the current
weather news worldwide and thus the app gives a complete insight of the weather condition.
